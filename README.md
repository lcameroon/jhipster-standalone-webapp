This application was generated using JHipster 5.0.2, you can find documentation and help at [https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v5.0.2](https://www.jhipster.tech/documentation-archive/v5.0.2).

## Development

Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1.  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/): We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
    Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    npm install

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:8001/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```bash
# with mock api
npm run start:mock
```

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `npm run test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `npm run e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
